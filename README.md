Phase 1 creating a MVC project: In this pattern design I explain how avoid create a massive View Controllers, separating every layer with his own responsibilities (base project)

Phase 2 incorporating a Delegate pattern: I’ll create a delegate pattern to communicate data between classes

Phase 3 incorporating a Strategy pattern: In this phase I’ll explain how this pattern can be used, and how can be interchangeable behaviors at run time

Phase 4 incorporating a Singleton pattern: In this phase I’ll explain how this pattern can be used, and when should you use it.

Phase 5 incorporating a Memento pattern: In this phase I’ll explain how this pattern can be used, for this example I’ll use a Encoder and Decoder 

Phase 6 incorporating an Observer pattern: In this phase I’ll explain how this pattern can be used.

Phase 7 incorporating a Builder pattern: In this phase I’ll explain how this pattern can be used. Incorporating a Director, Producer and Builder
